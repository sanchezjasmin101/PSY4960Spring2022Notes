What did you learn about GitHub? 

Most things make sense conceptually, so I feel that with practice I will understand everything better. 

One thing I learned about in the GitHub introductory course was that it's a streamlined program to collectively work on group projects. It is also a source that provides open research to other git hub users if the files are made public.

What's not clear? 

I'm not the quickest learner when it comes to technology, I don't really have comp sci experience. I thought it was kind of tough to navigate the site. I am still having a bit of trouble creating pull requests as well.

I learned how to navigate the basics of the site, though, I am still somewhat confused by everything. I mainly just need practice. 

The part that is unclear is if there are certain rules of etiquette when collaborating with others.
