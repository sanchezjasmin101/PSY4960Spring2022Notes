What did you learn about GitHub? 
I learned that GitHub is a Version Control System.  More specifically, I learned that a version control system allows users to continuously edit files without constantly copying them over and creating new files, while still maintaining access to view all of this history.
What's not clear? 
I’m a little confused about the history saved on Github.  If one were to commit changes and then want to go back, would they be able to recommit those changes if they changed their mind?  Or would you have to be 100% sure everytime you go back on a commit.
